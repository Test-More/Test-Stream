=head1 NAME

Test::Stream::Bundle::Classic - Bundle that emulates most of L<Test::More>. 

=head1 DESCRIPTION


=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<Note:> On ly the most critical functions are listed here. Please see
individual plugins for their functions.

    use Test::Stream '-Classic';

    ok(1, "This is a pass");
    ok(0, "This is a fail");

    is($foo, $bar, "These are the same using string comparison");

    like($foo, qr/x/, "This string matches this pattern");

    is_deeply({a => $foo}, {a => $foo}, "deep comparison");

    done_testing;

=head1 INCLUDED TOOLS

=over 4

=item Is => ['is', 'is_deeply']

This provides the C<is()> and C<is_deeply()> functions. These versions of the
function behave much like the L<Test::Stream> implementations, but with more
diagnostics. These both use the C<eq> operator when comparing scalar values.

See L<Test::Stream::Plugin::Is> for more details.

=item Compare => ['like']

This provides C<like()>. This can also provide other tools to make deep
comparisons easier, but they are not imported by default.

See L<Test::Stream::Plugin::Compare> for more details.

=item Core

This provides essential tools such as C<ok()>, C<done_testing()>, as well as
others.

See L<Test::Stream::Plugin::Core> for more details.

=item ExitSummary

This provides extra diagnostics at the end of failing tests.

See L<Test::Stream::Plugin::ExitSummary> for more details.

=item IPC

This loads IPC support so that threading and forking just work.

See L<Test::Stream::Plugin::IPC> for more details.

=item TAP

This sets TAP to be the default output format.

See L<Test::Stream::Plugin::TAP> for more details.

=item Subtest

This adds the C<subtest($name, sub { ... })> function. The output of this one
is a little different from L<Test::More> as it is buffered, that is doesn't gt
rendered until the subtest is done. This is important for concurrency support.

You can get the old style subtests this way:

    use Test::Stream -Classic, Subtest => ['streamed'];
