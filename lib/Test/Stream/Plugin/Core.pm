=head1 NAME

Test::Stream::Plugin::Core - Test::Stream implementation of the core Test::More
tools.

=head1 EXPERIMENTAL CODE WARNING

B<This is an experimental release!> Test-Stream, and all its components are
still in an experimental phase. This dist has been released to cpan in order to
allow testers and early adopters the chance to write experimental new tools
with it, or to add experimental support for it into old tools.

B<PLEASE DO NOT COMPLETELY CONVERT OLD TOOLS YET>. This experimental release is
very likely to see a lot of code churn. API's may break at any time.
Test-Stream should NOT be depended on by any toolchain level tools until the
experimental phase is over.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<This is not a drop-in replacement for Test::More>.

The new Testing library to replace L<Test::More>. This library is directly
built on new internals instead of L<Test::Builder>.

This module implements I<most> of the same functionality as L<Test::More>, but
since changing to this library from L<Test::More> is not automatic, some
incompatible API changes have been made. If you decide to replace L<Test::More>
in existing test files, you may have to update some function calls.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Test::Stream qw/Core/;

    plan($num); # Optional, set a plan

    # skip all tests in some condition
    skip_all("do not run") if $cond;

    if ($passing) {
        pass('a passing test');
    }
    else {
        fail('a failing test');
    }

    ok($x, "simple test");

    # Check that the class or object has the specified methods defined.
    can_ok($class_or_obj, @methods);

    # Check that the class or object is or subclasses the specified packages
    isa_ok($class_or_obj, @packages);

    # Check that the class or object consumes the specified roles.
    DOES_ok($class_or_obj, @roles);

    # Check that $ref is a HASH reference
    ref_ok($ref, 'HASH', 'Must be a hash')

    # The preferred way to plan
    done_testing;

=head1 EXPORTS

All subs are exported by default B<except> C<context()>. You can use '-all' to
import all subs, or you can use '-default' and specify 'context'.

    use Test::Stream::Plugin::Core '-all';

or

    use Test::Stream::Plugin::Core '-default', 'context';

You can also rename any sub on import:

    use Test::Stream::Plugin::Core '-default', is => {-as => 'compare'};

You can also load it when loading Test::Stream:

    use Test::Stream qw/Core/;

=head2 ASSERTIONS

=over 4

=item ok($bool)

=item ok($bool, $name)

=item ok($bool, $name, @diag)

Simple assertion. If C<$bool> is true the test passes, if it is false the test
fails. The test name is optional, and all arguments after the name are added as
diagnostics message if and only if the test fails. If the test passes all the
diagnostics arguments will be ignored.

=item pass()

=item pass($name)

Fire off a passing test (a single Ok event). The name is optional

=item fail()

=item fail($name)

=item fail($name, @diag)

Fire off a failing test (a single Ok event). The name and diagnostics are optional.

=item can_ok($thing, @methods)

This checks that C<$thing> (either a class name, or a blessed instance) has the
specified methods.

=item isa_ok($thing, @classes)

This checks that C<$thing> (either a class name, or a blessed instance) is or
subclasses the specified classes.

=item DOES_ok($thing, @roles)

This checks that C<$thing> (either a class name, or a blessed instance) does
the specified roles.

=item ref_ok($thing)

=item ref_ok($thing, $type)

=item ref_ok($thing, $type, $name)

This checks that C<$thing> is a reference. If C<$type> is specified then it
will check that C<$thing> is that type of reference.

=back

=head2 DIAGNOSTICS

=over 4

=item diag(@messages)

Write diagnostics messages. All items in C<@messages> will be joined into a
single string with no seperator. When using TAP diagnostics are sent to STDERR.

=item note(@messages)

Write note-diagnostics messages. All items in C<@messages> will be joined into
a single string with no seperator. When using TAP note-diagnostics are sent to
STDOUT.

=back

=head2 PLANNING

=over 4

=item plan($num)

Set the number of tests that are expected. This must be done first or last,
never in the middle of testing.

=item skip_all($reason)

Set the plan to 0 with a reason, then exit true. This should be used before any
tests are run.

=item done_testing

Used to mark the end of testing. This is a safe way to have a dynamic or
unknown number of tests.

=item BAIL_OUT($reason)

Something has gone horribly wrong, stop everything, kill all threads and
processes, end the process with a false exit status.

=back

=head2 META

=over 4

=item $todo = todo($reason)

=item todo $reason => sub { ... }

This is used to mark some results as TODO. TODO means that the test may fail,
but will not cause the overall test suite to fail.

There are 2 ways to use this, the first is to use a codeblock, the TODO will
only apply to the codeblock.

    ok(1, "before"); # Not TODO

    todo 'this will fail' => sub {
        # This is TODO, as is any other test in this block.
        ok(0, "blah");
    };

    ok(1, "after"); # Not TODO

The other way is to use a scoped variable, TODO will end when the variable is
destroyed or set to undef.

    ok(1, "before"); # Not TODO

    {
        my $todo = todo 'this will fail';

        # This is TODO, as is any other test in this block.
        ok(0, "blah");
    };

    ok(1, "after"); # Not TODO

This is the same thing, but without the C<{...}> scope.

    ok(1, "before"); # Not TODO

    my $todo = todo 'this will fail';

    ok(0, "blah"); # TODO

    $todo = undef;

    ok(1, "after"); # Not TODO

=item skip($why)

=item skip($why, $count)

This is used to skip some tests. This requires you to wrap your tests in a
block labeled C<SKIP:>, this is somewhat magical. If no C<$count> is specified
then it will issue a single result. If you specify C<$count> it will issue that
many results.

    SKIP: {
        skip "This will wipe your drive";

        # This never gets run:
        ok(!system('sudo rm -rf /'), "Wipe drive");
    }
