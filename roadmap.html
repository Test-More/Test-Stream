        <h2>Experimental Phase (current)</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Test-Stream released to cpan independant of Test::Builder</li>
            <li>Test-Stream reserves the right to break anything in its own dist in this phase</li>
            <li>Test-Simple dev releases that use Test::Stream</li>
            <li>Nothing production should depend on Test::Stream during this phase</li>
        </ul>

        The purpose of this phase is to allow people to use, and provide
        feedback on Test::Stream. It is a time of heavy churn, we want to be
        able to change things as needed.

        This phase will start (restart) when Test::Stream seems to be ready. In
        this phase focus will go into completing the punchlist set at the 2015
        perl-qa hackathon.
