=head1 NAME

Test::Sync::Event::Skip - Skip event type

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Skip events bump test counts just like L<Test::Sync::Event::Ok> events, but
they can never fail.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Test::Sync::Context qw/context/;
    use Test::Sync::Event::Skip;

    my $ctx = context();
    my $event = $ctx->skip($name, $reason);

or:

    my $ctx   = debug();
    my $event = $ctx->send_event(
        'Skip',
        name   => $name,
        reason => $reason,
    );

=head1 ACCESSORS

=over 4

=item $reason = $e->reason

The original true/false value of whatever was passed into the event (but
reduced down to 1 or 0).
