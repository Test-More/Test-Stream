=head1 NAME

Test::Sync::Util - Tools used by Test::Sync and friends.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Collection of tools used by L<Test::Sync> and friends.

=head1 EXPORTS

All exports are optional, you must specify subs to import.

=over 4

=item ($success, $error) = try { ... }

Eval the codeblock, return success or failure, and the error message. This code
protects $@ and $!, they will be restored by the end of the run. This code also
temporarily blocks $SIG{DIE} handlers.

=item protect { ... }

Similar to try, except that it does not catch exceptions. The idea here is to
protect $@ and $! from changes. $@ and $! will be restored to whatever they
were before the run so long as it is successful. If the run fails $! will still
be restored, but $@ will contain the exception being thrown.

=item USE_THREADS

Returns true if threads are enabled, false if they are not.

=item get_tid

This will return the id of the current thread when threads are enabled,
otherwise it returns 0.

=item my $file = pkg_to_file($package)

Convert a package name to a filename.
