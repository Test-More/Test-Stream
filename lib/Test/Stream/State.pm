=head1 NAME

Test::Stream::State - Representation of the state of the testing

=head1 EXPERIMENTAL CODE WARNING

B<This is an experimental release!> Test-Stream, and all its components are
still in an experimental phase. This dist has been released to cpan in order to
allow testers and early adopters the chance to write experimental new tools
with it, or to add experimental support for it into old tools.

B<PLEASE DO NOT COMPLETELY CONVERT OLD TOOLS YET>. This experimental release is
very likely to see a lot of code churn. API's may break at any time.
Test-Stream should NOT be depended on by any toolchain level tools until the
experimental phase is over.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item $num = $state->count

Get the number of tests that have been run.

=item $num = $state->failed

Get the number of failures (Not all failures come from a test fail, so this
number can be larger than the count).

=item $bool = $state->ended

True if the state has ended. This MAY return the stack frame of the tool that
ended the test, but that is not guarenteed.

=item $bool = $state->is_passing

=item $state->is_passing($bool)

Check if the overall state is a failure. Can also be used to set the pass/fail
status.

=item $state->bump($bool)

Increase the test count by one, C<$bool> should be true if the new test passed,
false if it failed.

=item $state->bump_fail

Increase the failure count, and set is_passing to false.

=item $state->plan($plan)

=item $plan = $state->plan

Get or set the plan. The plan must be an integer larger than 0, the string
'no_plan', or the string 'skip_all'.

=item $state->finish([$package, $file, $line])

This is used to finalize the state, no changes should be made to the state
after this is set.
