=head1 NAME

Test::Stream::Sync - Primary Synchronization point, this is where global stuff
lives.

=head1 EXPERIMENTAL CODE WARNING

B<This is an experimental release!> Test-Stream, and all its components are
still in an experimental phase. This dist has been released to cpan in order to
allow testers and early adopters the chance to write experimental new tools
with it, or to add experimental support for it into old tools.

B<PLEASE DO NOT COMPLETELY CONVERT OLD TOOLS YET>. This experimental release is
very likely to see a lot of code churn. API's may break at any time.
Test-Stream should NOT be depended on by any toolchain level tools until the
experimental phase is over.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

There is a need to synchronize some details for all tests that run. This
package stores these global objects. As little as possible is kept here, when
possible things should not be global.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Test::Stream::Sync; # No Exports

    my $init  = Test::Stream::Sync->init_done;
    my $stack = Test::Stream::Sync->stack;
    my $ipc   = Test::Stream::Sync->ipc;

=head1 CLASS METHODS

This class stores global instances of things. This package is NOT an object,
everything that uses it will get the same stuff.

=over 4

=item $bool = Test::Stream::Sync->init_done

This will return true if the stack and ipc instances have already been
initialized. It will return false if they have not.

=item $stack = Test::Stream::Sync->stack

This will return the global L<Test::Stream::Stack> instance. If this has not
yet been initialized it will be initialized now.

=item $ipc = Test::Stream::Sync->ipc

This will return the global L<Test::Stream::IPC> instance. If this has not yet
been initialized it will be initialized now.

=item $bool = Test::Stream::Sync->no_wait

=item Test::Stream::Sync->no_wait($bool)

This can be used to get/set the no_wait status. Waiting is turned on by
default. Waiting will cause the parent process/thread to wait until all child
processes and threads are finished before exiting. You will almost never want
to turn this off.

=item Test::Stream::Sync->add_hook(sub { ... })

This can be used to add a hook that is called after all testing is done. This
is too late to add additional results, the main use of this hook is to set the
exit code.

    Test::Stream::Sync->add_hook(
        sub {
            my ($context, $exit, \$new_exit) = @_;
            ...
        }
    );

The C<$context> passed in will be an instance of L<Test::Stream::Context>. The
C<$exit> argument will be the original exit code before anything modified it.
C<$$new_exit> is a reference to the new exit code. You may modify this to
change the exit code. Please note that C<$$new_exit> may already be different
from C<$exit>

=back

=head1 MAGIC

This package has an END block. This END block is responsible for setting the
exit code based on the test results. This end block also calls the hooks that
can be added to this package.
