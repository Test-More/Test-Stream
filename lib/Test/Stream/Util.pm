=head1 NAME

Test::Stream::Util - Tools used by Test::Stream and friends.

=head1 EXPERIMENTAL CODE WARNING

B<This is an experimental release!> Test-Stream, and all its components are
still in an experimental phase. This dist has been released to cpan in order to
allow testers and early adopters the chance to write experimental new tools
with it, or to add experimental support for it into old tools.

B<PLEASE DO NOT COMPLETELY CONVERT OLD TOOLS YET>. This experimental release is
very likely to see a lot of code churn. API's may break at any time.
Test-Stream should NOT be depended on by any toolchain level tools until the
experimental phase is over.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Collection of tools used by L<Test::Stream> and friends.

=head1 EXPORTS

=over 4

=item ($success, $error) = try { ... }

Eval the codeblock, return success or failure, and the error message. This code
protects $@ and $!, they will be restored by the end of the run. This code also
temporarily blocks $SIG{DIE} handlers.

=item protect { ... }

Similar to try, except that it does not catch exceptions. The idea here is to
protect $@ and $! from changes. $@ and $! will be restored to whatever they
were before the run so long as it is successful. If the run fails $! will still
be restored, but $@ will contain the exception being thrown.
