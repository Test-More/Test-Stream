Test::Stream::Plugin::Capabilities - Import constants to check the capabilities
of the current system.

B<This distribution is deprecated> in favor of L<Test2>, L<Test2::Suite>, and
L<Test2::Workflow>.

See L<Test::Stream::Manual::ToTest2> for a conversion guide.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sometimes you want to know what capabilities the current system has. Checking
on these can sometimes be complicated or error prone. This tool provides
constants for some common capability checks.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Test::Stream qw/... Capabilities/;

    if (CAN_THREAD) {
        ... Code that uses threads ...
    }

    if (CAN_FORK) {
        ... Code that forks ...
    }

    if (CAN_REALLY_FORK) {
        ... Code that requires true forking, but breaks with pseudo-fork ...
    }

=head1 CHECKS

See L<Test::Stream::Capabilities> for a list of checks, this plugin is a simple
wrapper around it.
