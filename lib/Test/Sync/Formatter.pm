=head1 NAME

Test::Sync::Formatter - Namespace for formatters.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the namespace for formatters. This is an empty package.

=head1 CREATING FORMATTERS

A formatter is any package or object with a C<write($event, $num)> method.

    package Test::Sync::Formatter::Foo;
    use strict;
    use warnings;

    sub write {
        my $self_or_class = shift;
        my ($event, $assert_num) = @_;
        ...
    }

    1;

The C<write> method is a method, so it either gets a class or instance. The 2
arguments are the C<$event> object it should record, and the C<$assert_num>
which is the number of the current assertion (ok), or the last assertion if
this even is not itself an assertion. The assertion number may be any inyeger 0
or greator, and may be undefined in some cases.
